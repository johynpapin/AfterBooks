# AfterBooks
The git repository of AfterBooks website : http://afterbooks.tk/.

## What is it ?
AfterBooks allows you to discover new books according to your readings...
AfterBooks actually responds to a simple question: What to read after ?

## Why open source ?
I spent a lot of time creating this site, and use of the framework to Meteor.js was a first for me, and I know that the code is not ergonomic. Advocate of open source, I decided to put it online in order to give an example of using this framework, and perhaps get suggestions.
